# JCB! Admin Views

JCB! Admin Views are the heart of every component generated by Joomla Component Builder. They transform your data model into a
fully working Joomla administration experience by compiling database tables, CRUD controllers, list and edit layouts, toolbar
buttons, ACL rules, and even optional dashboard widgets in one move. Because the compiler understands how Admin Views relate to
fields, Dynamic Gets, and site-side assets, a single well-structured view scales from quick prototypes to enterprise-grade data
applications without manual boilerplate.

## Why Admin Views are a flagship feature

JCB accelerates Joomla development by letting you describe an Admin View once and letting the compiler do the heavy lifting. The
resulting features include:

* **Instant database schema** – every Admin View defines and maintains its table structure with field-level versioning.
* **Generated MVC stack** – list and edit layouts, models, controllers, batch actions, filters, and toolbars compile automatically.
* **Granular permissions** – Joomla ACL switches expose per-view and per-field access, ready for enterprise governance.
* **Relationship management** – subforms, Dynamic Gets, chained filters, and conditional display logic connect Admin Views without
  extra SQL.
* **Reusable assets** – layouts, templates, custom code placeholders, and language strings travel with the view so you can fork or
  reset them between projects.

Pair this conceptual overview with the long-form walkthrough in the
[JCB! Admin Views tutorial transcript](../Admin-Views.md) whenever you want timestamps, screenshots, or deeper examples.

## When to create an Admin View

Create an Admin View whenever you need to manage structured data inside a component—articles, configurations, catalogues, or any
object that deserves CRUD operations. JCB components will not compile without at least one Admin View, so treat it as the starting
point for every project. From there you can bolt on [Custom Admin Views](../Custom-Admin-Views.md) for dashboards or
[Site Views](../Adding-Site-Views-to-a-Component.md) for the public interface, all powered by the same data foundation.

## Prerequisites checklist

Before diving into the builder, make sure you:

1. Understand how [JCB! Fields](../JCB-Fields.md) control database columns and form widgets.
2. Plan your data structure using the tips in [General Planning](../General-Planning.md#12-admin-views-and-field-creation).
3. Install or update JCB following the [installation guide](../Installation-of-JCB.md) so that sample data and field libraries are
   available.

## Step-by-step: building your first Admin View

Follow these practical steps to create a robust Admin View. Each step is designed so that even first-time users can produce a
professional Joomla backend screen on their first attempt.

1. **Open the Admin Views area**
   1. Launch Joomla Component Builder in your Joomla administrator.
   2. In the sidebar, choose **Admin Views → New**.
   3. Give your view a **Single name** (singular) and **Plural name** (list label). Stick to lowercase, underscore-separated names
      for predictable table aliases.
2. **Describe the view**
   1. Add short and long descriptions to help teammates understand the purpose.
   2. Select the **Type**: `Read/Write` for editable records or `Read Only` for audit logs and lookup tables.
   3. Assign an icon so the view stands out on the component dashboard. The
      [Adding Admin Views to a Component guide](../Adding-Admin-Views-to-a-Component.md#2-adding-view-icons) shows recommended sizes.
3. **Attach fields**
   1. Switch to the **Fields** tab.
   2. Click **Add Field** and reuse existing field definitions or create new ones on the fly.
   3. Reorder fields with drag-and-drop to group related inputs. Reference the
      [Field Types overview](../Field-Types.md#7-admin-fields-and-views) for suitable widgets.
4. **Model relationships**
   1. Use the **Linked Views** tab to connect subforms or parent-child relationships.
   2. Configure list filters and ordering for relational fields to make navigation intuitive.
   3. When you need aggregated data, attach Dynamic Gets following the
      [dynamicGet guide](../dynamicGet.md#overview).
5. **Refine the experience**
   1. Enable version history, batch actions, export/import, and metadata switches in the **Options** tab.
   2. Set Joomla ACL defaults in the **Permissions** tab so editors, managers, and admins have the right access out-of-the-box.
   3. Drop custom CSS, JavaScript, or PHP into the provided placeholders to extend behaviour without hacking generated code.
6. **Link the view to your component**
   1. Visit **Components → Your Component → Admin Views** inside JCB.
   2. Toggle where the view should appear (main menu, dashboard module, submenu, quick actions).
   3. Compile and install the component. Detailed screenshots live in the
      [Admin View integration walkthrough](../Adding-Admin-Views-to-a-Component.md).
7. **Test and iterate**
   1. Open the compiled component in Joomla’s administrator to add sample records.
   2. Confirm list filters, permissions, and toolbar buttons behave as expected.
   3. If you need to adjust the schema, update the Admin View and recompile—JCB handles database migrations via the
      [automated SQL updater](../Auto-create-SQL-updates-for-Componets-in-JCB.md).

## Productivity tips

* **Reuse proven views** – Reset or fork Admin Views from shared repositories so your team starts with audited schemas and UI
  patterns.
* **Keep logic declarative** – Leverage conditions, chained fields, and Dynamic Gets before writing custom PHP. Declarative
  settings survive regenerations and speed up onboarding.
* **Document choices** – Use the description fields and commit messages to explain why each view exists. Future collaborators can
  then jump straight into the feature using the links above.

## Next steps and related learning

* Continue with [Custom Admin Views](../Custom-Admin-Views.md) to build dashboards that consume the same data.
* Explore [Setup Site Edit View](../Setup-Site-Edit-View-in-JCB.md) to surface your Admin View data on the frontend.
* Bookmark the [Features directory index](../Features/README.md) once additional feature guides are published (coming soon).
