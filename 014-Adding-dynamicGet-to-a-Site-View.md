# ADDING DYNAMICGET TO A SITE VIEW

### Checking The Target Dataset

Now that we have the dynamicGet in place, let's add it to a site view and look at the initial implementation. Go to site view and click on new. Since we already have what you created, we will just open preacher.

### Populate Fields From Get's

On the right-hand there are three fields you can populate with your dynamicget methods. The first is where you'd add all the custom dynamicgets. There you can add multiple custom dynamicgets. The second is where you add your main dynamicget as we explained in the dynamicget tutorial. You can add one main get method per site view since it will be buildt in the model, either as a getitem or getitems. [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m57s) It depends whether the main get it is a list or an individual item. Whatever the case, you may include as many custom dynamicgets as you like. You have this data available in your view. (See video.) These two first fields are used to load the dynamicget to the view.

### Dynamic Values

The third  is used to display. [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m37s) You might want to implement the code of a specific dynamicget option. This one displays main gets; this one customer gets; this both the custom and the main kind of gets. [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m04s) If you select one of these main gets you will see that it shows a list printout of the possible ways you might use the result set. [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m32s) (You can copy 
each of these by clicking on it; right click and copy or ctrl C and command C to copy the content.) Perhaps you only want to use part of it and not include the echo statement: click from the area where you want to copy and before letting go click on control C or command C. [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m05s) In a mac once you let it go it will select the whole block; if you copy it then, you will copy everything.

### Inserting Values Into View

We use Dynamic Values code in the default view to display the data in a PHP way. [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m36s) You can get the customerget here. The value is going to be in this preacher. (Make sure you have a preacher.) This block deals with displaying the data related to the information. This one here checks whether the main items are on the page. (See video.) [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m08s) The main items are sermons, preacher.id, getlist, etc. If you go down to the sermon preacher, you'd get list; the values are in items. It's an array. You can loop through it and target the object values. That's what's being done here. First check whether the values are on the page. [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m38s) If we see that it is there, we make use of templates to display the various layouts. [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m01s)

### Making Use of Data Being Passed Through to the View

This data structure is the data structure you can expect from each one of these Custom Gets. (See video.) If you were to take number sermons as the method you want to see, it shows the way that it might be packed into the data set. [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m36s) It'll be found in this 'numbersermons'. It could change depending on the custom implementation in your components custom coding areas. You might move this data from that position to something else. The reality is that Dynamic Values gives you a chance to see how it would have looked without leaving the normal path. [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m10s)

### Var Dump

This is proposing the dataset structure: ideally you'd this value here, and do this in the code. (See video.) Do a var_dump, exit, do a build, and look at the view to see the structure. [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m45s) If you are finding that this structure isn't working as we expected, this might help map the array and see where which value is found. The same goes with any of the others. Grab that area that you want to peek into, place it in var_dump, do a build, and look at the page in the front of your site. You can see the structure of the object here, whether it's an array, an array with objects, or whatever is placed inside this value set through the dynamic get method. (See video.) [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m20s)

### Gets In The Code eg: Preacher.php

Let's look at how Custom Gets methods are becoming available in your view by going to the code and looking at some of the implementations that we've done. We've gone to the front of the site. (See video.) [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m55s) We open and use the preacher model. As you scroll down you see that a getListquery. This getlistquery gets sermon as the 'a' table, series as the 'c' table, preacher is the 'd' table, and categories as the 'b' table. [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m18s) Now it looks for value in id, sets it equal to preacher, ensures that the person has access level to the item that's published, and returns it. [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m41s) That is the getListquery in the model. If we go back to our interface, we have sermon (preacher.id)(getlist) as the main. [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m06s)

### Looking At The Dynamic Get

I've opened that dynamic get here. Sermon is set as 'a,' the main table. If you open Join View Table - Add, series is set as 'c' looking for selection values. Preacher is set as 'd', only selection values. Statistics 'e' is a list. It is multiple. [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m36s) These(preacher, series) single ones are part of the listquery whereas the multiple of it would have its own method. We will look at that quickly, and then we see in the Join DB table - add that we have category as single, as 'b' those values. Going back to the code. [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m01s) This is the getListquery, in the getitem after we have received the items, we look through them and then in this function here getSermonstatistics and then a generated string(Fcff_E) to ensure no conflicting with other methods on the page. Puts the values in 'id sermonsstatisticsE'. [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m30s) That's where the values are placed. We have a custom method here. Like we shown in the dynamic get you can add custom methods, and returns the items to the page. 

### Preacher view.html.php Generated Code

In the page you have a file that is called: [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m55s)  view.html.php. If you open the file you see that there is a get items method being used to place the items in items. At the moment we are actually in the view at this stage. That means you can access this set of values inside of that class field. [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m26s) If we go back to our Component Builder, you would see if we were to select that(sermon (preacher.id)(getlist)) method, there is the items corresponding to our code. We know that the id. and the asset_id, in all these are in there. 

### Checking The Target Datasets

If you scroll down, you will see that there is a 'idsermonstatisticsE'. So that means in the array there is a [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m03s) key value which has another set of array values in it. You can target these data sets by corresponding pointing values. That is just looking at the main get. If we were to look at the other custom get [00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m28s) that is been added. We'll see that here's preacher, which is a custom method that is been added. It also has its set of values and it's database structure and remember we set that we want it to be link to the preachers id. So can I check for the id, [00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m53s) and then set it to id, returns to result. Same goes with the number of downloads. It's also custom method that set to this view because of the custom get that was added. Here is the numbersermons. As we go back to our view.html.php file, we see that those values are respectively being added [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m21s) to preacher. number downloads, and number sermons. You can use these values in the view by targeting with this number sermons.

### Site Preacher Tmpl Folder

Now the view itself is, as you should know inside of the template folder, under the views preacher. This main view as we call it or the default view, is where that code that we on the page that we looking at [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m50s) being placed. All these others are the templates that are extending the site view. They possibly are extended through layouts that are available in the layouts folder. We are just looking at adding the custom get methods to the page in our next to tutorial. We are going in depth about adding templates to your custom site view, and making use of these data sets. [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJZe6XqHJE&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m24s) That is how you link them, your first create the custom get, then you come here, you link these. So these are the linking fields and these are just so that you can see the code snippets are making use of these fields respectively. That is custom gets added to site view.
