I would like to talk to you about changing the licence template For your component. This would be expected that you've made at least 40 % change To any of the demo components. Let's say you've changed Sermon Distributor component quite considerably. There is this place called Licensing Template. It tells you there what you should do. [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m34s) 'Select the file that should be used for license all files (files found in: administrator/components/com_ componentbuilder/compiler).  What I should do is add to the note the txt files. You could put any txt file in there. Then select it as a License Template. 

### Demonstration - How It Works

[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m57s) 

Now let me show you how that works. First of all It must be done when the Joomla Component Builder is already installed on your website. I have a website Joomla Mount. In administrator, components, com_componentbuilder. There is a folder called compiler [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m21s) and in it there is 5 txt files. Going back to the component, there is 5 files. I see it's also using the HTML. That one will not come out right. These ones with the .txt's, the one that you would select, any one of those to be the template that you are going to use. 

### Changing The Templates

If you are using one of the existing templates and change it, then with the next update your changes will be overwritten. You want to do it in a way that preserved your changes. The way you do that is you go back to the compiler area and then select [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m13s) select the default one. And maybe you don't like this(see video). You want to take that out. Maybe you don't want to support or show that you use JCB. Take that out. I really don't mind. I'm a supporter of open-source that [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m36s) I don't mind you changing anything except @copyright and @license, that I want you to leave. These placeholders are being replaced by the settings of your component. [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m58s) You could still tweak this, but do it in the component. But leave the license and copyright notice that people can know how to use your program. Having said all that, you should realize that a lot of the code between all the components that JCB built are more or less the same. It's little names here and there. That's really the only thing you are copyrighting. [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m26s) Just keep that in mind. You're not copyrighting every little line, you are copyrighting the changes. The idea of how built is already been copyrighted either by Joomla or by JCB. Keep that in the back of your head. You are copyrighting the changes you've made and that which you have done. When someone uses your component they won't think about it that way. I don't mind and I don't think [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m00s) anyone would because we are an open source community. If you do change your program to a proprietary software, you might have to look at what would be the implication. I think there's a possibility that some areas cannot be made proprietary, because of the Open Source license already is on JCB [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m28s) and on everything that it has done. I'm not sure I'm not a lawyer. I don't know how all that works out. I want to give many people so much freedom and I'm not going to check people up. Someone else may, there is places that might feel obligated to do so. I want to be busy with code. Writing programs.

This is how you change the template more or less. You could leave things in. The one that I think is the most let's see You can check between them You see like this the way to know what is all the place holders that are available Is really to go to the Let's see helper Compiler I think it's that infusion is 1 So [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m29s) You should look at the infusion Now like There is a company name you see there's a creation date There's the built date there's author, author e-mail website copyright license version Actual version Component names for short description description Image type access so they are Really Most of these aesthetic A content placeholders could be used obviously some of them won't make sense like custom helper [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m01s) Script that Means it's got add the custom helper script in that lines It's not gonna come out right So these Place holders are really from where The content is being updated in the file Ok so you'll see That it is the same This is a new method we are using to put it in the hashes these these hashes here So Basically the creation date Is this one here [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m31s) And it's getting it from the infusion which is found in helpers compiler So you can check out these and use any of those as you like The point being It's best to leave this in And at least tell people who who who you do did it so someone Can be blamed anyway And There we go now If you just save now It'll still work the default template will be updated [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m03s) But the problem is the sooner we released a new update for JCB and you install that update Is actually gonna over right this So what we would suggest the saying save as And then give it your name I'm just gonna say q Default q Save Now we have a new file And we can actually go back to JCB [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m32s) And we can just refresh the component area And now we'll see that there it is The new Template Now if I save And compile this component It will actually Use the new template now let me first see do I have it installed yes I do let me show you that So in the code we go down to sermon distributor we just open any of its files And that's how it's current template looks like [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m03s) Ok so there is the current template All the way down to there Now let's compile and see It'll update every file across the Spectrum So we just gonna say sermon distributor and compile Ok and then this install it Now let's go check out our template And now if we scroll up we see up it's got the new [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m36s) The new Template is being used no longer the old one It's the same file I just it just refreshed it In the background Ok so That how it works Easy To change the license and that's really means you can make it a small or is big as you like Any shape and size Just keep in mind that you need to escape it and unescape it [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m02s) Because otherwise it will mess up the code Ok well that is how you change the license template Now So Make a wise decisions and how you deal with this area I don't wanna say too much more and put You know restraints up because really I know that The initial Desire here Was really to give everybody as much freedom as they need [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AveBf6YZzmo&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m35s) Thank you for watching.
