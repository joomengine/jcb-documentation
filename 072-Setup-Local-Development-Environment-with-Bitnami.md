I want to give you a quick tutorial on how to use Bitnami on your local development environment. Bitnami is a very well known Distributor of images. They have association with Amazon. They know what they are doing. For local developing environment I found them most convenient. But then again that is if you are not afraid of command line which you shouldn't be. Command line is an amazing world for you to make use of as a developer. It'll be good for you to just jump in. 

### Installing Bitnami Joomla Stack

[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h00m43s) 

The first thing I did, google Bitnami Joomla together and you'll see there is a download Joomla Bitnami and Bitnami Joomla installer and how to install Bitnami Joomla. Even on Joomla a documentation installing, Joomla using Bitnami, Joomla. We can open the link. [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m13s) We'll see that it has a recommended stack for Windows, Linux and Mac. You will get a little setup Bitnami Joomla Stack tutorial. I t will take you through the process of installation, helps you select the place, adds information and then you are done. [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h01m42s) It does what other similar components do, but I have experience it is targeting Joomla, it really does and places everything. You could click on Bitnami website link or you can click there at the bottom where it says Bitnami.org stack Joomla. That's the same as the first one. You could also click on this result. I should download it and run it but because I'm on a Linux environment you would click on WIN/MAC/LINUX. [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m26s) Select the environment which you're in. Click Download. I'm waiting for the download to start. Save the file to your local system. Run the file. 

### Download - Using Windows/Mac/Linux

[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h02m54s)

If you are using Microsoft, they have executable (exe) file, you can double click on it and that should get you going. The same goes for Mac. You can double click on the file and it will run you through tutorial. I'm using Linux which is a little bit different because it using a run file and you need to start it from the command line. As you can see [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h03m35s) I have downloaded it, and it already have Joomla 3.8.11. It's always up-to-date. If you're on a Linux system you would open in terminal, do a quick ls la and I will see the file is not executable.  We'll make it executable. They will be sudo chomd +x and the file name, enter. It'll ask you for your password, and type it in. Wrong command, the typo, it should be chmod. [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m23s) The file is executable. Check it out its sl is correct. Once you've done that you can close the command line. It was to run chmod command over here to make the file executable. Which is a safe and making sure that it runs correctly. [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h04m53s) You could double click on the file in your file system. It should start a Bitnami tutorial. Select language, Welcome to Bitnami Joomla Stack, and yes we want all of this installed. We are going to set /home/llewellyn/joomla_bitnami [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h05m36s) and click next. You can give some defaults.

????
 I'm going to add a simple password, click next And it's asking for the MySQL port The I know that I've already got MySQL installed here let's see which is 3 0 6 so 3 0 7 should be OK just gonna give it a name [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m10s) I'm not gonna do email here And I'm not gonna Try and link up with Bitnami's Cloud And then we're done Next It's basically going to run the installer And deploy Everything you need the PHP the MySQL [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m30s) Joomla with its Database It's really setting everything up for you And if you gonna be doing local development I suggest using this path because it takes care Everything for you And does it in a way that doesn't affect You're already existing PHP And you're ready existing SQL and everything else it really packages it into a folder Which [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h06m58s) I've just like using we're almost there doing now the MySQL Database creating the databases This can take long depending on your systems resources now to removing the Things that it doesn't need Well actually it's setting up and uninstaller Script so if you didn't like This you could Then undo it [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h07m46s) Are we done Now you can launch the Bitnami Joomla Stack and just click finish And there we go we got it installed now to access the Joomla sign It basically using my Local IP right and then we go Joomla and there is our Joomla website And obviously to access the admin Admin There we go now to login here they have default passwords and stuff set [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h08m26s) Basically the one that you typed in during the installation And there we go we are Here and we want to get JCB So we install the The web tab and we type here JCB enter And it comes up we click on it And we say install It usually will grab the master branch which Is usually in sync with the latest release [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m00s) And we install It's also not counting these downloads so that's one of the reasons we don't have any idea How many are using JCB at the moment Ok once it's installed You can actually go and open JCB We are now on a little Screen issue here I just downsize a bit But here we go let's grab A demo package by going to install JCB packages [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h09m37s) And here is VDM packages And there's the community packages And we can Grab Any of these let's just take the Hello World And get the package so as you can see I've done nothing I've just deployed Bitnami, I haven't touched any other feature of PHP or anything else it just grabs the package And it validates the checks sum for us we force it to update And we click continue [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m13s) And now it's importing the hello world component And there we go it's done Just to show we quickly go here and we compile Hello World And install And here we go Hello World is there And it is working We can add a greeting And It's It's doing everything is expected [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h10m40s) We also can check the front end Main menu Change the main menu by Using the Hello World greetings And save and close Just before we do that we go back to Hello World we opened the options check out the permissions we search for Site We see there is two and they're already set to allowed greetings if not you just change them to allowed for the public [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m14s) And that is the the two areas you would like And then you can click here And there is some text you see it We have not Given the public actually the edit rights so it will say that it's not available But it can actually check some text and go back to home So we see that the Hello World tutorial is functioning on our Bitnami Within How long did this take 11 minutes [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h11m46s) Anyway Thanks for watching that just a quick demonstration of setting up a local developing environment with Bitnami And the reason why I take this path Is primarily because of what I'll show you next Here you have the bitnami folder remember we've typed it in And there's your Apache There is all the files And You want to go into the apps folder Then into the Joomla folder [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m17s) And into the htDocs folder in here is your whole Joomla website and you can you can open And go in and actually Work on your components And edit it's files so this this is really the biggest reason I want to be able to Easily access the files and work with them And so it is it's very doable here The other feature which just comes out of the box by Default Is actually if you go back enough You'll see It is that it has [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h12m54s) In the apps folder, you can see that has the PHP my admin installed So that means You could type here PHP my admin And be right there able to access PHP my admin and check out of databases This all Bitnami did out of the box without real complications anyway that's the Reason I like using bitnami on my local developing environment and they are quite quick With the updates you can actually if we go back to that folder You'll see that it has your and uninstall and a manage Files [00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h13m39s) So you could run this one to uninstall and you can run this one to manage the environment Which does actually check whether the server is up the configurations and Civil events and stuff like that You can stop all And then the other one which I like is that you can click here Uninstall Do you want to uninstall Bitnami Joomla stack and all it's models. yes And it starts to uninstall everything removes everything so you could run This do some work save your components export your JCB packages and then completely This thing and [00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpS52k89YcI&list=PLQRGFI8XZ_wtGvPQZWBfDzzlERLQgpMRE&t=00h14m28s) Move on But it's dangerous do keep in mind it really removes everything Ok well that's this is now the end
