The directories, folders and files of the JCB Demo component, found in the JCB Demo installation package named com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip is presented here for your convenience. For simplicity, it is recommended you install only Joomla! and the JCB component without installing the demo component using the Joomla! installer. This allows you to focus on the following:

* JCB
* JCB Demo package
* JCB areas containing the Demo code
* JCB functions and features used while building the Demo component
* JCB interaction with the Joomla! API

This process will introduce you to a typical MVC directory structure and the files it contains for a component that is not complex. You will find most of it is common to all components, regardless of their complexity. Keep in mind as you progress through the videos and accompanying chapters in this manual that variations will occur and this structure will become more complex with many additional files. However, they all share one thing in common which is the MVC paradigm and follow its basic directory and file structure.

The last bullet above is extremely important to understand as we have stated earlier. There will be directories, files and code in the files you may ponder over with the JCB Demo and your own components; you will wonder how they got there. JCB leverages the Joomla! API to accomplish this. Go the extra mile and cross reference everything as was done here in your demo.txt file, using a word processor to create similar tags. The process is very tedious, but will reinforce the many areas of JCB where the component's directories and files were created automatically by JCB. This includes the code you have written and placed in various areas of the JCB component during the build process.

This process also allows one to understand directories, files and code contained in them are generated by JCB for the JCB features and functionalities you implemented, whether they are in your own code placed in the appropriate locations in JCB, or ones JCB generates itself if the feature or functionality is implemented without supporting code written by you but by the JCB code supplemented extensively by reusing and extending core code supplied by the Joomla! API as much as possible. You will also have a valuable reference for the component you analyzed this way and how JCB produced it in case you need to review something in your own component that may have been a bit fuzzy at the time. After a while you will not need to do this as it will become ingrained and be automatic as you gain expertise with the JCB component building process.

Unzip com_demo_v2_0_0__J3.zip and using the shell or command line, list its directories, sub-directories and all the files contained in them, by changing to the root of the directory and typing dir > demoDirectory.txt /s if using the Microsoft Windows command line as one example. Other operating systems have a similar command in their shell. You can browse the directory using the file manager for your operating system like Windows Explorer or better yet, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like NetBeans. An IDE is recommended since it has many features facilitating this analysis. Some of these include a file manager to browse through the directory tree and files, opening one or several at a time in separate windows, plus using the IDE to quickly locate base classes in the Joomla! API that are reused and extended by JCB or searching through the directory for all uses of anything you wish to search for.

You can also use a debugging tool like XDEBUG in NetBeans for example and other IDE's to facilitate your analysis and your development efforts. Just a few of these features are single stepping through code while it executes or adding breakpoints and watches in JCB and the JCB Demo component to pause execution while you analyze the stack showing everything that was executed up to this point plus examining classes methods and their properties is indispensable and save a tremendous amount of time if for some reason you have execution errors in your component, or are analyzing some complex parts of the component you are developing that are no working as you anticipated as just one example. after it has been launched in your browser like Chrome to easily locate in JCB where and how its code produced the class, method and its properties you are focusing on. See the Appendix in this manual titled Debugging for examples of this and other features this IDE and others have to offer that enhance the JCB build process and allow you to quickly identify and resolve an issue in your code during run time.

It is also possible to browse the zip file directly using Windows File Explorer as one example, but creating the text file and performing the same analysis of it for your own component or ones freely supplied by JCB, as some are rather complex,  is an excellent exercise. Make notes in your text file as you browse through the directories and files on your development site for later review or revisiting concepts that perhaps were not very clear at the time. Follow along as you go through the directory tree on your system. Locate and open the files in each one shown below and view its contents.

Beneath the directory structure and files presented next you will find a short explanation of their relation to the component, the areas of the JCB component that builds each and JCB's interaction with the Joomla! API. You'll see how JCB reuses and extends Joomla!'s abstract base classes, including their methods and properties to implement the many features and functions built into JCB which are utilized by it while building a component. As you peruse the directory structure and files, links are available allowing you to quickly go to the explanatory text below the directory structure for that file, including a reference to where in JCB it originated from and any interaction between JCB and the Joomla! API.
